        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The Roblox Friend Finder website allows a player to login and search for new friends along with many additional features.
            These other feautures include adding and removing friends, a following system, purchasing items, finding new experiences
            to join, and interacting with groups.  This website is scripted in Python, HTML, and PostgreSQL.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Notable features</h2>
        <p>This program can recommend new friends based on an SQL query that returns friends of friends.  There an SQL query that
            displays new experiences on the home page of the user based on similarities in tags of the experiences that the user has 
            visited in the past.  If a one user blocks another user, that user cannot follow or friend the first user.
        </p>
        <p>Since working with databases may involve dealing with personally identifiable information, we implemented some security 
            features. Our website can counter SQL injections by checking user input against a specified set of characters for input.
            A randomly generated authentication token is used when a user is logged in to prevent threat actors from gaining 
            unauthorized access to the website.
