        These other feautures include adding and removing friends, a following system, purchasing items, finding new experiences
        to join, and interacting with groups.  This website is scripted in Python, HTML, and PostgreSQL.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Notable features</h2>
    <p>This program can recommend new friends based on an SQL query that returns friends of friends.  There an SQL query that
        displays new experiences on the home page of the user based on similarities in tags of the experiences that the user has 
        visited in the past.  If a one user blocks another user, that user cannot follow or friend the first user.
