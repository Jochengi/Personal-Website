    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>My Common Words Finder project is created in Java and is capable of solving any given text document. The program 
        currently finds the <i>n</i> most common words in the text document and shows how many times each word appears. It also
        displays the total number of unique words in the text document. This program uses the binary search tree, AVL tree, 
        and hash map algorithms.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Notable features</h2>
    <p>This program identified the 10 most common words of the 13,677 unique words in the Bible in 326 milliseconds.</p>
